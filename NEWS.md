# zeallot 0.0.4

## Major Changes

* The bracket and colon syntax has been deprecated in favor of a lighter syntax
  which uses calls to `c()`. Documentation and vignettes has been updated
  accordingly. Using the old syntax now raises a warning and will be removed in
  future versions of zeallot. (@hadley, #21)
  
## Minor Improvements

* `%<-%` can now be used for regular assignment. (@hadley, #17)
* `...` can now be used to skip multiple values without assigning those values
  and is recommended over the previously suggested `....`. (@hadley, #18)
  
## Miscellaneous Changes

* `massign()` is no longer exported.

## Bug Fixes

* Numerics on left-hand side are no longer unintentionally quoted, thus no
  longer treated as valid variable names, and will now raise an error. 
  (@hadley, #20)
* Language objects on left-hand side are no longer treated as symbols and will
  now raise an error. (@hadley, #20)

# zeallot 0.0.3

* see 0.0.2.1 notes for additional updates

## Minor Improvements

* Examples now consistently put spaces around colons separating left-hand side
  variables, e.g. `a : b` instead of `a: b`.

## Bug Fixes

* When unpacking an atomic vector, a collector variable will now collect values
  as a vector. Previously, values were collected as a list (#14).
